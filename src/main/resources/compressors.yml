# This config file is where you can add your own custom compressors to the game.
# Make each new compressor "compressor#", where # is a number incremented by 1 from the previous compressor.
# MAKE SURE to include at least the display-name and material parameters for each compressor.

# Note: Adding ItemStacks (like the start-item and final-item in the compressions section) is MUCH, MUCH easier
# using the in-game GUI, accessible with /editcompressors . I would recommend just using this either way, since
# adding color codes directly in here requires using the § (section) sign (U+00A7).

# Example (safe to delete this):
#compressor1:
#  display-name: §6§kaa§r§6 Auto Compressor §kaa§r
#  lore:
#    - '§7§oAutomatically compresses these items:'
#    - §3  Diamonds -> Block of Diamond
#    - §4  Redstone -> Block of Redstone
#    - §6  Gold -> Block of Gold
#    - §7  Iron -> Block of Iron
#  material: diamond_block
#  enchant-glint: true
#  location: OFFHAND
#  compressions:
#    compression1:
#      start-item:
#        ...
#      final-item:
#        ...
#      start-amount: 9
#      final-amount: 1
